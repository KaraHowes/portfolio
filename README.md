# portfolio
This is my portfolio: it represents who I am and what I have done thus-far as a frontend-developer.
I was inspired by the guidelines set out by the Technigo Team and used HTML, CSS and flexbox to builld the site.
Using HTML and CSS validation tools, I have ensured my portfolio is accessible to all viewers. The website has been checked on 3 different browsers -Chrome, Firefox and Micrsoft edge.
