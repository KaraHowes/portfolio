# portfolio
The aim of this project was to build a portfolio to represent who I am and what I have done.
I am not following the career coaching program, nonetheless was inspired by their approach. I used HTML, CSS and Flexbox toi build the website. 
Using HTML and CSS validation tools, I have ensured my portfolio is accessible to all viewers.
